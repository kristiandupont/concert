# Concert

Convert media files.

This app runs webasm versions of [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) directly in the browser, allowing you to convert file formats without sending yor files to any server.

If you need to convert a file, just go to the [live page](https://kristiandupont.github.io/concert/) and drop it!

This project uses [Crank.js](https://crank.js.org/) as the frontend framework.
